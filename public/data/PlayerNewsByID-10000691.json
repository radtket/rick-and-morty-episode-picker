[{"NewsID":69644,"Source":"RotoBaller","Updated":"2018-05-31T00:25:14","TimeAgo":"over 9 months ago","Title":"Christian Yelich Cannot Stop Hitting The Ball","Content":"Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich went 2-for-5 with a home run, one run and two RBI in the 3-2 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. Yelich has been on fire for practically the entire month of May but has been especially good as of late. In Yelich's last seven games, he is batting .433 with a 1.218 OPS, 10 runs, two home runs, seven RBI and three stolen bases in only 30 at-bats. Yelich will provide a solid mix of contact, power and speed and should be owned in all fantasy formats.","Url":"https:\/\/www.rotoballer.com\/player-news\/christian-yelich-cannot-stop-hitting-the-ball-over-last-seven-days\/505582","TermsOfUse":"RotoBaller news feed is provided for limited commercial and non-commercial use.
