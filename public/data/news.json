All three have their issues and all three probably should be avoided in mixed leagues. Cobb is the most attractive in AL-only leagues, while Cashner was downright awful in 2018 and Bundy has yet to prove that he can stay healthy, let alone be successful at the major league level. Cashner was shut down in September and finished 4-15 with a 5.29 ERA and 1.58 WHIP in 153 innings. Avoiding Baltimore's pitching staff as a whole is a smart idea for fantasy owners.",

The deal also includes performance-based incentives, probably for games finished. While Archie Bradley and Yoshihisa Hirano are capable of closing out games, Holland has more experience and might be the favorite now for ninth-inning duties in the desert. Holland has three seasons of 40-plus saves, including two years ago with the Rockies, but he had an unsightly 4.66 ERA, 1.62 WHIP and 9.1 K/9 in 56 outings (three saves) between the Cardinals and Nationals last year. Even if he does get the job in Arizona closing out games, he'll be a shaky fantasy closing option at risk of losing the job to either Bradley or Hirano if he falters.",

The former top prospect threw just four innings last year before dealing with shoulder issues after missing all of 2017 due to Tommy John surgery. The right-hander could serve as a starter, long reliever or late-inning reliever this year if he's healthy, but one thing that is certain is that he has a ton of upside if he's in the starting rotation. His spring will give us a better idea of how the Cardinals plan to use him, but Reyes is certainly worth a look in the later rounds of drafts for his upside alone.

Martin played in just six games with the Indians before his illness hit, and he played in 78 games with the Tigers before being traded to Cleveland. He hit a combined .255/.323/.425 with 11 home runs, 33 RBI and seven stolen bases on the year. Even though Martin is likely to be the starter in center field, questions about his health or how he'll rebound will make him one to avoid in mixed leagues to begin the season.",

		"Content": "The Chicago White Sox offered free-agent shortstop Manny Machado an eight-year deal on Sunday and could be compelled to give him more years, according to league sources. The Phillies are also engaged with Machado, but at this point it appears they are more interested in trying to land superstar outfielder Bryce Harper. While the White Sox clearly want Machado, it doesn't appear that they are willing to exceed $300 million to get him, at least not yet. He turns 27 next July and is already one of the best offensive and defensive players in all of baseball, regardless of position. The fact that he is eligible at both third base and shortstop makes him a top-10 overall fantasy asset, regardless of where he lands. Both Philly and Chicago would offer fine hitting environments as well.",

He played outfield his first year in San Diego but then played first base for two years before the team signed Eric  Hosmer. Myers played in just 83 games last year for the Friars due to injury, hitting .253/.318/.446 with 11 home runs, 39 RBI and 13 stolen bases. With better health, Myers could easily rebound after he hit a combined 58 home runs and stole 48 bases from 2016 to 2017. Look to draft Myers as a value pick in the early middle rounds because of his power-speed combination.",

		"Content": "The New York Mets agreed to a two-year, $20 million deal with free-agent second baseman Jed Lowrie on Thursday, according to league sources. The 34-year-old had a career year in Oakland in 2018, setting career highs in homers (23), RBI (99) and walks (78) for a surprising A's team that made the playoffs. It's a bit of an odd fit since the Mets already traded for Robinson Cano and have Jeff McNeil on roster, but Lowrie will likely fill some sort of utility role. Lowrie's former agent, Brodie Van Wagenen, is now the general manager in New York. Given Lowrie's age, we may have just seen his high-water mark, so don't overspend on him in spring drafts. He should play every day, but the crowded Mets roster is a concern for Lowrie's owners if he struggles to begin the season. The biggest loser is obviously McNeil, but he could gain outfield eligibility.",

The Tribe acquired Plawecki from the Mets last weekend, and he's expected to be the primary catcher in 2019 alongside Roberto Perez.

While the Phils will meet with free-agent outfielder Bryce Harper in person in Las Vegas this Saturday, they haven't made him a formal offer and it's unclear if they will. It remains unlikely that the Phillies will sign both Machado and Harper.

MadBum has missed considerable time the last two years due to injuries and is due a $12 million salary in 2019. The Giants may wait until midseason to trade the veteran left-hander, however. Bumgarner had a 3.26 ERA, 1.24 WHIP and 109 strikeouts in 21 starts last year, so he still has the stuff to be effective despite turning 30 this August. While Milwaukee would be a downgrade for him as far as the ballpark factor, Bumgarner still can be a high-end fantasy starter in 2019.",
